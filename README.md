# Django Full Stack Milestone Project
For my Django Full Stack Milestone Project, I have created a website called “Your Wedding Invitations”.  This website displays a variety of wedding invitation designs where the user can select the one they like and add their own wedding details to it.  They can then order and pay for their selected products through the website.  They can also register and log in to their user account at any time. 

## UX
I want my website to have a modern wedding feel and appearance.  It will have an intuitive interface and present the information clearly on mobile devices as it does on desktop.
A typical user of this app would be looking for the following: 

### User stories

1. **A person not used to navigating websites** will need a simple interface for them to navigate.  They will need to know immediately what options are available to them and what the website has to offer.
2. **A bride (or groom) to-be** would be immediately looking to see the different type/design of invitations that the site has to offer (upon landing on the page).
3. **A returning/registered user** will want to see what details they have entered along with the design they have selected and the price they have paid.  They would also like to see a status update for their order.
4. **A user looking for further information** will be looking for options to submit a query.

### Mock-ups and Database Schema
The mock-ups I used for planning the application are in a "wireFrames" folder inside my images folder under the names **ProjectWireframe_1.png** , **ProjectWireframe_2.png** , **ProjectWireframe_3.png** , **ProjectWireframe_4.png** , **ProjectWireframe_5.png** and **ProjectWireframe_6.png**

My database schema can be found in the "database-schema" folder inside my images folder as **dbschema.png**.  I created my database in dbdiagram.io.
